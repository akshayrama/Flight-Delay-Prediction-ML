# Flight-Delay-Prediction-ML
This is a two stage predictive analysis model to determine whether or not a given flight would be delayed on arrival. If so, it predicts the arrival delay in minutes. Flight data and weather data is first merged into a single dataset. Using that dataset, classification and regression stages are performed.
